"### **Adobe | Conceptual Round: Spread Operator Pitfall**

**Question:** What will be logged? How do you fix this using the spread operator while keeping the code readable?

const state = {
  user: { 
    id: 101, 
    details: { 
        city: 'Bangalore' 
        } 
    },
  theme: 'dark'
};

const newState = {...state };
newState.user.details.city = 'Chennai';

console.log(state.user.details.city); 
// Expected output? Why did it change?"

Output:
Chennai

Explanation:
const newState = {...state }; // This line is performing a shallow copy, not a deep copy.
user is copied by reference, theme by value (since its primitive), so if you do 
newState.theme = 'white'; 
console.log(state.theme); // Output- dark


How do you fix this using the spread operator while keeping the code readable?
const newState = {
  ...state,
  user: {
    ...state.user,
    details: {
      ...state.user.details,
      city: 'Chennai'
    }
  }
};
